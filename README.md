# JS2-Miniprojekt-3-Lian-Natta
This is Natta and Lian's mini project which contains a shopping website based on Plantagen. 

We have decided to make this whole project in English. This applies to website, comments in code, commit messages etc. 

Project has been co-coded by us at times, and individually coded when we've been in separate locations. We started by creating a project with issues to keep track of our tasks and we have handled them and taken on things along the way. 

***** THIS WEBSITE IS NOT YET FINISHED. IT IS STILL IN PROGRESS! A FEW METHODS AND A CONNECTION TO CHECK STOCK BALANCE IS MISSING. *****
